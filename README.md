## What is it?

**It can...**

- [x] Be used to execute untrusted code
- [ ] Timeout long-running code and infinite loops
- [x] Handle errors gracefully
- [x] Run restricted code
- [x] Pass rich data structures back
- [ ] Capture console output

```js
const s = new Sandbox();

s.eval("const o = { answer: 4.2 }; o", function(err, res) {
  console.log("The answer is: %d", res.answer * 10);
});
```

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save sandbox
```

By default the package will attempt to download the corresponding binary release
for your platform. If you wish to skip this action you can set the
`SANDBOX_SKIP_DOWNLOAD` environment variable:

```sh
env SANDBOX_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1 npm install --save sandbox
```

## About

`sandbox` is a tool to allow safe local execution of JavaScript.

The previous version of `sandbox` attempted to accomplish this by spawning a
child process and running the untrusted code in a new Node.js context with known
exploits patched. Unfortunately this didn't work well from a security standpoint
and it became increasingly difficult to keep up with the whack-a-mole of
security vulnerabilities. In fact, the previous version still has unaddressed
vulnerabilities that are impossible to patch with that architecture.

The current version of `sandbox` takes a new approachâ€”it embeds a JavaScript
interpreter in the library which executes code in a separate context in another
thread. This is made possible with the help of two incredible projects:

- [Boa][doc-boa] - a JavaScript interpreter written in [Rust][doc-rust]
- [Neon][doc-neon] - a library for interfacing with [Node-API][node-napi]

The major drawback to this approach is that it either requires the user to build
the `sandbox` locally from source (which requires the user to have the rust
build tools onhand) or pre-built binaries for every platform would need to be
provided. In order to make things a little more seamless for users, we've opted
to provided pre-built binaries for the following platforms:

- Linux x86_64
- MacOS arm64
- MacOS x86_64
- Windows x86_64

Given these targets we should be able to meet the needs of most users.

## Building

First, if you don't already have the rust toolchain installed you can follow the
instructions for installing rustup:

[Install rust][rust-install].

Next, running `npm run build` will attempt to build the project with
[cargo][doc-cargo] and move the compiled binary to `./index.node`.

At this point you should be able to work with `sandbox` and run the tests: `npm
test`.
